# How the Program Works:

## Initialization:

The program initializes a Tkinter window with a menu bar.
A "File" menu is added to the menu bar, containing two options: "Do Secret option" and "Exit".
## Dynamic Menu Item Control:

The program provides three buttons: "Toggle Item", "Show", and "Hide".
Clicking the "Toggle Item" button toggles the visibility of the "Do Secret option" menu item.
Clicking the "Show" button shows the hidden "Do Secret option" menu item.
Clicking the "Hide" button hides the visible "Do Secret option" menu item.
Executing Hidden Function:

When the "Do Secret option" menu item is clicked, it executes a hidden function named "hidden_function()".
This function simply prints a message indicating that the hidden function is executed.
Exiting the Program:

Clicking the "Exit" menu item gracefully exits the program.
## Demo Program:

This program serves as a demo to illustrate dynamic menu item control in a Tkinter GUI application.
It showcases how menu items can be manipulated and controlled dynamically based on user interaction.
Menu Item Labels:

The visibility of the "Do Secret option" menu item is controlled using the labels label1 and label1_hidden.

The label1_x variable is used as a temporary label for toggling the visibility of the "Do Secret option" menu item. In the program, when the "Toggle Item" button is clicked, it swaps the labels between label1 and label1_x, effectively changing the displayed text of the menu item.

## label1_x is needed as Temporary Placeholder:

label1_x serves as a temporary placeholder for the label of the menu item while toggling its visibility.
When the "Toggle Item" button is clicked, it swaps the labels between label1 and label1_x, making the menu item text appear as intended.
Ensuring Consistency:

By using a temporary variable like label1_x, we ensure that the original label (label1) is preserved and can be restored when needed.
This helps maintain consistency and ensures that the program behaves as expected when toggling the visibility of the menu item.
Toggle Functionality:

The label1_x label acts as an intermediary state during the toggle operation.
It allows the program to seamlessly switch between showing and hiding the menu item without losing track of the original label.
Overall, label1_x is an essential component of the toggle functionality in the program, enabling smooth transitions between different states of the menu item's visibility.

## Additional Notes:

The program ensures that the buttons have the same size for a uniform appearance.
Menu items are dynamically renamed based on their visibility status.
User Interaction:

Users can interact with the program by clicking the buttons or selecting menu items.
The program provides visual feedback to users based on the actions performed.

## Summary:
The Dynamic Menu Item Control program is a demo that showcases how to manipulate and control menu items dynamically in a Tkinter GUI application. Users can toggle, show, and hide menu items based on their requirements, and hidden functions can be executed discreetly. This program serves as a practical example of dynamic UI control and user interaction in Python GUI programming.
